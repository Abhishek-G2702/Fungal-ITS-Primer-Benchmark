1.This file contains the all_species_mismatch data, which was generated by the script code5_mismatch.py 
and is named code5_mismatch_Primer_Results.
2.This file (species_without_primer_after_mismatch_in_pathogenic_fungi) lists the pathogenic fungal species
that have zero primers remaining after the mismatch analysis.
3.The combined_bar_graph file visualizes the percentage of primer pairs for two groups: a comprehensive set of 168,030 species 
and a subset of 1,640 pathogenic species, showing the results both before and after mismatch analysis.
